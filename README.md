# OrderAndDisorder

## Project Overview

[This site](https://wars2kk.github.io/OrderAndDisorder) is a project dedicated to Canto 4 of Lucy Hutchinson's *Order and Disorder*, an epic poem full of Biblical allusions. This project allows readers of *Order and Disorder* to easily track the Biblical references that Hutchinson makes without needing to constantly reference a Bible. 

## How to Use The Site

### General Usage

Lines in Canto 4 that include Biblical references feature a dotted underline. To see the passage that is being referenced, simply click the desired line and read the reference that appears on the right-hand side of the screen. 

By default, the site only returns the individual verse or group of verses referenced directly in the Canto. However, it can be helpful to read the Biblical passage in context. In that case, select **Verse and Chapter** from the first drop-down box, then re-click the desired line to see the entire chapter that Hutchinson's reference comes from. 

The default version of the Bible is the King James Version. However, the Bible in Basic English as well as the World English Bible are also available. To change versions, choose the desired version from the second drop-down box. 

### Tools

To search through Canto 4, simply use ``ctr + f`` or ``cmd + f``. 

To see where and how often each book of the Bible is referenced, click the **Tools** button, then select a book from the drop-down menu in the **Tools** pop-up window.
