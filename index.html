				<h1>Canto 4</h1>

			<div id="cantoBox">
				<div class="reference" onclick="getVerse('genesis','1','31')">Good were all natures as God made them all,</div>
				<div class="reference" onclick="getVerse('romans','9','22')">Good was his will, permitting some to fall:</div>
				<div class="reference" onclick="getVerse('romans','11','')">That th’rest, renouncing their frail strength, might stand</div>
				<div class="reference" onclick="getVerse('romans','3','6')">Humble and firm in his supporting hand;</div>
				<div class="reference" onclick="getVerse('genesis','18','25')">His wisdom and omnipotence might own</div>
				<div class="reference" onclick="getVerse('romans','11','33')">When his foes’ power and craft is overthrown;</div>
				<div class="reference" onclick="getVerse('1corinthians','10','12')">Seeing his hate of sin, might thence confess</div>
				<div>His pure innate and perfect holiness,</div>
				<div class="reference" onclick="getVerse('romans','16','20')">And that the glory of his justice might</div>
				<div class="reference" onclick="getVerse('psalms','2','')">In the bold rebels’ torturing flames seem bright; 10</div>
				<div class="reference" onclick="getVerse('joseph','24','19')">That th’ever-blessed Redeemer might take place</div>
				<div>To illustrate! his rich mercy and free grace</div>
				<div class="reference" onclick="getVerse('psalms','5','5')">Whereby he fallen sinners doth restore</div>
				<div>To fuller bliss than they enjoyed before;</div>
				<div class="reference" onclick="getVerse('1peter','1','')">That virtue might in its clear brightness shine,</div>
				<div class="reference">Which, like rich ore concealéd in the mine,</div>
				<div class="reference">Had not been known but that opposing vice</div>
				<div class="reference">Illustrates it by frequent exercise.</div>
				<div class="paragraphBreak"></div>
				<div class="reference">If all were good, whence then arose the ill?</div>
				<div class="reference">Twas not in God’s, but in the creatures’ will,</div>
				<div>Averting! from that good which is supreme,</div>
				<div class="reference">Corrupted so, as a declining stream</div>
				<div class="reference">That breaks off its communion with its head,</div>
				<div class="reference">By whom its life and sweetness late were fed,</div>
				<div>Turns to a noisome, dead, and poisonous lake,</div>
				<div>Infecting all who the foul waters take:*“#</div>
				<div>Or as a branch cut from the living tree</div>
				<div>Passes into contempt immediately,</div>
				<div>And dies divided from its glorious stock;</div>
				<div>So strength disjoinéd from the living rock</div>
				<div>Turns to contemnéd imbecility,</div>
				<div class="reference">And doth to all its grace and glory die.</div>
				<div class="paragraphBreak"></div>
				<div>Some new-made angels thus, not more sublime</div>
				<div>In nature than transcending in their crime,</div>
				<div>Quitting th’eternal fountain of their light,</div>
				<div class="reference">Became the first-born sons of woe and night,</div>
				<div class="reference">Princes of darkness and the sad abyss,</div>
				<div class="reference">Which now their curséd place and portion is,</div>
				<div class="reference">Where they no more must see God’s glorious face</div>
				<div>Nor ever taste of his refreshing grace,</div>
				<div>But in the fire of his fierce anger dwell,</div>
				<div>Which though it burns, enlightens not their hell.</div>
				<div>But circumstances that we cannot know</div>
				<div>Of their rebellion and their overthrow</div>
				<div>We will not dare t’invent, nor will we take</div>
				<div>Guesses from the reports themselves did make</div>
				<div>To their old priests, to whom they did devise</div>
				<div>To inspire some truths, wrapped up in-many lies;</div>
				<div>Such as their gross poetic fables are,</div>
				<div>Saturn’s extrusion, the bold Giants’ war,</div>
				<div>Division of the universal realm</div>
				<div>To gods that in high heaven steer the helm,</div>
				<div>Others who all things in the ocean guide,</div>
				<div>And those who in th’infernal court preside,</div>
				<div>Who there a vast and gloomy empire sway,</div>
				<div>Whom all the furies and the ghosts obey.</div>
				<div class="paragraphBreak"></div>
				<div>But not to name these foolish impious tales,</div>
				<div>Which stifle truth in her pretended veils,</div>
				<div>Let us in its own blazing conduct go</div>
				<div>And look no further than that light doth show;</div>
				<div>Wherein we see the present powers of hell,</div>
				<div>Before they under God’s displeasure fell,</div>
				<div>Were once endued with grace and excellence</div>
				<div class="reference">Beyond the comprehension of our sense.</div>
				<div>Pure holy lights in the bright heaven were</div>
				<div class="reference">Blazing about the throne, but not fixed there;</div>
				<div>Where, by the apostasy of their own will ,</div>
				<div>Precipitating them into all ill,</div>
				<div class="reference">And God’s just wrath, whose eyes are far too pure</div>
				<div class="reference">Stained and polluted objects to endure,</div>
				<div class="reference">They fell like lightning, hurled in his fierce ire,</div>
				<div class="reference">And, falling, set the lower world on fire:</div>
				<div class="reference">Which their loose prison is where they remain,</div>
				<div class="reference">And walk as criminals under God’s chain</div>
				<div>Until the last and great assizes come,</div>
				<div class="reference">When execution shall seal up their doom.</div>
				<div class="paragraphBreak"></div>
				<div class="reference">Thus are they now to their created light,</div>
				<div class="reference">Unto all truth and goodness opposite, _</div>
				<div class="reference">Hating the peace and joy that reigns above,</div>
				<div>Vainly contending to extinguish love,</div>
				<div>Ruin God’s sacred empire, and destroy</div>
				<div>That blessedness they never can enjoy.</div>
				<div>A Chief they have, whose sovereign power and place</div>
				<div>But adds to’s sin, his torture, and disgrace.</div>
